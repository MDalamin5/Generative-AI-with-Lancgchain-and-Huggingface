Simplify x^3 + 7x^2 - 2x^3.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
First, combine like terms x^3 and -2x^3 to get -x^3. That yields -x^3 + 7x^2. Then, factor out x^2 to get x^2(7 - x). Do you understand this step? (Yes, I understood this step/No, I did not understand this step/Explain More)

I'm a bit confused about how x^3 and -2x^3 become -x^3.
<|end|>

<|assistant|>
We add their coefficients: 1 + (-2) = -1, so x^3 + -2x^3 = -x^3. Does that clarify?
<|end|>

<|user|>
Yes, that makes sense now.

<|assistant|>
Great! The simplified expression is x^2(7 - x). Good work! Would you like to try another problem?

We can tackle this by first combining like terms. Do you have any idea which terms are alike?

I'm not sure; can I get a hint?
