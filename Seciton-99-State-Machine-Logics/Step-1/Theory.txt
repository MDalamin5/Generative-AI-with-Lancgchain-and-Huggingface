1. Basic Theory of State Machines
1.1. What is a state machine?
A state machine is a model of behavior composed of:

States: The system’s possible situations or modes.
Events (or inputs): Triggers that cause changes.
Transitions: The rules for moving from one state to another when an event occurs.
1.2. Key Components

State: A condition in which your system can remain for some period. (e.g., “RED” in a traffic light)
Event: Something that happens that might cause a transition. (e.g., “Timer Expired”)
Transition: The rule that says “If the system is in State A and Event X occurs, move to State B.”
1.3. Deterministic vs. Nondeterministic Machines (Briefly)

Deterministic: From a given state with a given event, there is exactly one next state.
Nondeterministic: From a given state with a given event, there could be multiple valid next states (less common in typical programming, more of a formal automata theory topic).
1.4. “Finite” vs. “Extended” State Machines

A finite state machine has a limited number of states.
Real-world systems often use “extended” state machines that include data variables and conditions. But the core concept is the same.
Exercise: In your notebook or a simple text file, list out 2–3 everyday scenarios that can be modeled by states and transitions (e.g., “door” states: Locked, Unlocked). Identify possible events (LockDoor, UnlockDoor, BreakIn, etc.) to get comfortable with the idea.

2. Designing a Simple State Machine
2.1. Real-World Example: Traffic Light

States: RED, GREEN, YELLOW
Events: timer_expired, emergency_override
Transitions:
RED + timer_expired → GREEN
GREEN + timer_expired → YELLOW
YELLOW + timer_expired → RED
ANY_STATE + emergency_override → RED
2.2. Listing Events and Transitions
Write them in a table or dictionary format:

Current State	Event	Next State
RED	timer_expired	GREEN
GREEN	timer_expired	YELLOW
YELLOW	timer_expired	RED
Any	emergency_override	RED
2.3. Drawing a State Diagram
Diagram:

Copy
   [RED] ----timer_expired----> [GREEN]
     ^                             |
     | (emergency_override)        | timer_expired
     |_________________________ [YELLOW] 
Exercise: Sketch the traffic light diagram on paper or a whiteboard. Add any additional transitions you think make sense.
