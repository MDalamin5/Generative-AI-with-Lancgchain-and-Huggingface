Overview of the Roadmap
Basic Theory of State Machines
1.1. What is a state machine?
1.2. Key components (states, transitions, events).
1.3. Deterministic vs. nondeterministic state machines (briefly).
1.4. “Finite” vs. “infinite” or “extended” state machines.

Designing a Simple State Machine
2.1. Identifying states in a real-world example (traffic light).
2.2. Listing events and transitions.
2.3. Drawing a state diagram.

Implementing a State Machine in Code
3.1. Bare-bones approach: dictionaries or switch statements.
3.2. A small example in Python (or your preferred language).
3.3. Testing the machine with example inputs.

State Machine Patterns and Best Practices
4.1. Entry and exit actions.
4.2. Guards (conditions on transitions).
4.3. Hierarchical state machines (nested states).
4.4. Parallel states (if needed).

Practical Example: A Chatbot or Tutoring Scenario
5.1. Defining high-level steps (states) for a conversation.
5.2. Handling user inputs as events.
5.3. Integrating minimal state machine logic with an external system (like an LLM).

Advanced Libraries or Tools
6.1. The transitions Python library.
6.2. UML state diagrams and tooling.
6.3. Testing strategies for complex state machines.

Wrap-Up and Extensions
7.1. When to use a state machine vs. other approaches.
7.2. Combining state machines with more open-ended AI logic (RAG, LLM calls).
7.3. Further resources and references.
