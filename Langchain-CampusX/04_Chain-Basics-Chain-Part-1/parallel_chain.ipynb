LinearSVC uses squared_hinge loss and due to its implementation in liblinear it also regularizes the intercept, if considered.

In the binary case, the probabilities are calibrated using Platt scaling [9]: logistic regression on the SVM’s scores, fit by an additional cross-validation on the training data. In the multiclass case, this is extended as per [10].\n",

    "Avoiding data copy: For SVC, SVR, NuSVC and NuSVR, if the data passed to certain methods is not C-ordered contiguous and double precision, it will be copied before calling the underlying C implementation. You can check whether a given numpy array is C-contiguous by inspecting its flags attribute.\n",

    "For LinearSVC (and LogisticRegression) any input passed as a numpy array will be copied and converted to the liblinear internal sparse data representation (double precision floats and int32 indices of non-zero components). If you want to fit a large-scale linear classifier without copying a dense numpy C-contiguous double precision array as input, we suggest to use the SGDClassifier class instead. The objective function can be configured to be almost the same as the LinearSVC model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel cache size: For SVC, SVR, NuSVC and NuSVR, the size of the kernel cache has a strong impact on run times for larger problems. If you have enough RAM available, it is recommended to set cache_size to a higher value than the default of 200(MB), such as 500(MB) or 1000(MB).\n",

    "Setting C: C is 1 by default and it’s a reasonable default choice. If you have a lot of noisy observations you should decrease it: decreasing C corresponds to more regularization.\n",

    "LinearSVC and LinearSVR are less sensitive to C when it becomes large, and prediction results stop improving after a certain threshold. Meanwhile, larger C values will take more time to train, sometimes up to 10 times longer, as shown in [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine algorithms are not scale invariant, so it is highly recommended to scale your data. For example, scale each attribute on the input vector X to [0,1] or [-1,+1], or standardize it to have mean 0 and variance 1. Note that the same scaling must be applied to the test vector to obtain meaningful results. This can be done easily by using a Pipeline:\n",

However, if we loosely solve the optimization problem (e.g., by using a large stopping tolerance), the code without using shrinking may be much faster\n",

The underlying OneClassSVM implementation is similar to the ones of SVC and NuSVC. As no probability estimation is provided for OneClassSVM, it is not random.\n",

    "The underlying LinearSVC implementation uses a random number generator to select features when fitting the model with a dual coordinate descent (i.e. when dual is set to True).

      "### Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Overview\n",
      "- Used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.\n",
      "- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
      "- Only a subset of training points (support vectors) are used in the decision function, making it memory-efficient.\n",
      "- Versatile: allows different kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Advantages\n",
      "- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
      "- Handles cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
      "- Memory-efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Disadvantages\n",
      "- Can overfit if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples.\n",
      "- Does not directly provide probability estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Practical Use\n",
      "- **Scaling**: Scale data to [0,1] or [-1,+1], or standardize to mean 0 and variance 1.\n",
      "- **Randomness**: SVC and NuSVC can be randomized; use `random_state` to control randomness.\n",
      "- **Regularization**: Large C leads to less regularization, while small C results in more regularization.\n",
      "- **Caching**: Increase cache size for better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Classification\n",
      "- **Classes**: SVC, NuSVC, and LinearSVC for binary and multi-class classification.\n",
      "- **Multi-class Strategy**: SVC and NuSVC use \"one-vs-one,\" while LinearSVC uses \"one-vs-rest.\"\n",
      "- **Probability Estimation**: Use `probability=True` for probability estimates but note it can be computationally expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Regression\n",
      "- **Classes**: SVR, NuSVR, and LinearSVR.\n",
      "- **Regularization**: Use grid search to find optimal C and gamma values.\n",
      "- **Kernel Functions**: Linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Implementation\n",
      "- **Libraries**: Uses libsvm and liblinear for computations.\n",
      "- **Scaling and Performance**: LinearSVC is faster and more scalable for large datasets compared to SVC.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quiz Question\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a key advantage of Support Vector Machines (SVMs)?**\n",
      "\n",
      "a) SVMs are memory efficient because they only use a subset of training data (support vectors) for decision function.\n",
      "b) SVMs are always faster than other classifiers due to their linear time complexity.\n",
      "c) SVMs provide probability estimates directly, making them ideal for uncertainty quantification.\n",
      "d) SVMs are insensitive to the number of features in comparison to the number of samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**\n",
      "\n",
      "a) SVMs are memory efficient because they only use a subset of training data (support vectors) for decision function.\n",
